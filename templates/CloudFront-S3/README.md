# Templates for CloudFront and S3 - Web Distribution

```
 ____________     _____     
| CloudFront |-->| S3  |
|____________|   |_____|
```

Two ways to integrate CloudFront with S3 for Web Distributions (e.g. api.example.com):

1. Use Custom Origins
    1. Use the S3 bucket as static website (use url: http://api-example-com.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com)
    1. The S3 bucket needs to set to Public Read, i.e. it can be accessible directly without through CloudFront 

1. Use S3 Origins
    1. Use the S3 bucket as a bucket (use url: api-example-com.s3.amazonaws.com)
    1. Use Origin Access Identity to restrict S3 access only to CloudFront
    1. Need to give a Default Root Object (i.e. index.html) for accessing the single page app 
    1. Need to redirect 403 to index page

  http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/DownloadDistS3AndCustomOrigins.html)


1. Use S3 with static website hosting for storing static content.
1. Use CloudFront and Route53 for supporting https requests and defining custom (api) domain. 
1. Upload example.com SSL certificate to AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).


## Steps to create infrastructure

1. Create a IAM Group for deployment using `IAM-Group-ForDeployment.template` with CloudFormation.

1. Create a S3 Log bucket as the root-logs bucket (for all logging) using `S3-RootLogs.template` with CloudFormation.

1. Upload a server (ssl) certificate to IAM [using aws-cli](
   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html#upload-server-certificate):

   ```
   > aws iam upload-server-certificate \
        --server-certificate-name example \
        --certificate-body file://example.crt \
        --private-key file://example.key \
        --certificate-chain file://intermediate.crt \
        --path /cloudfront/
   ```

   To retrieve the `ServerCertificateId` or other certificate details:
   
   ```
   > aws iam list-server-certificates (--profile your-aws-profile)
   ```

1. Add Origin Access Identity for CloudFront to interact with S3 buckets.

   (if you use `CloudFront-S3-WebDistribution-UseS3Origin.template`)

   Note that an Origin Access Identity [cannot be created with CloudFormation](
     https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20632828/aws-cloud-formation-script-to-create-s3-bucket-and-distribution).

1. Use CloudFormation template `CloudFront-S3-WebDistribution-xxx.template` to

    1. Create S3 bucket with Static Website, Versioning and Logging enabled.
    1. Create Bucket Policy for PublicRead access (if using Custom Origins approach).
    1. Create a Managed Policy for managing and uploading files to the S3 bucket.
    1. Attach the Managed Policy to the given Group.
    1. Create a CloudFront Distribution
    
1. Add new Route53 record set for each CloudFront Alias as CNAME pointing to
   the CloudFront Domain name.


#### Notes

##### CloudFront: Error: NoSuchKey? [Ref](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15309113/amazon-cloudfront-doesnt-respect-my-s3-website-buckets-index-html-rules)

1. Check the “Origin Domain Name” of that distribution.
1. DO NOT use the domain name of the S3 bucket which was provided in the auto-complete droplist, e.g. “mywebsite.s3.amazonaws.com”.
1. Use the actual hosting domain name, e.g. “mywebsite.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com”.

##### When granting permission to CloudFront to access S3 through Origin Access Identity

In the CloudFormation template, specify (where xxxxxx is S3 CanonicalUser ID)

```
"Principal": {
  {"CanonicalUser": "xxxxxx"}
},
```

Then the BucketPolicy to be created will become:

```
"Principal": {
  "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::cloudfront:user/CloudFront Origin Access Identity xxxxxxxxxxxx"
},
```
